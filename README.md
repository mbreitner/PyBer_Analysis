# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis:
   The purpose of this analysis was to utilize our pandas and matplotlib skills to identify the total weekly fares over a certain period of time. We wanted to create a multiple line graph to display the total weekly fares by city type over time and easily compare the city types. 

## Results
   What we can see from the results of our analysis is, as you move further from an urban area, the total number of rides and available drivers will steadily decrease. Due to the lower supply of riders and drivers in suburban and rural areas, we can see the average fare per ride start to increase compared to the average fare in urban areas. As the average fare per ride increases as you move further away from urban areas, the average fare per driver will steadily increase as well, which ultimately costs PyBer more money to pay the drivers. 
  
   Ultimately, the dataframe we created displays this information in an easy to read format that clearly outlines the totals and averages for each city type.

   From what we can see in the multi-layered line chart we created, we can see that despite the differences in the average fares and total number of rides/drivers, there is a collective increase in activity in all city types during the end of February. The beginning of March sees a collective decrease in activty and total fares. Each city type follows a similar trendline until April where we see suburban areas begin to have another sharp increase whereas urban and rural areas begin to see another decrease.

## Summary
  1. PyBer should spend additional time researching why the suburban fares have a drastic difference in total fares in the beginning of April compared to urban and rural areas. 
  2. Knowing that the end of February across the board has more spend than other months, PyBer should anticipate having more drivers available to meet the demand of the riders. 
  3. PyBer should also look into acquiring more drivers in rural areas because the average fare price is so high. If they can provide more drivers, they can steadily increase the demand and take in more profits.
